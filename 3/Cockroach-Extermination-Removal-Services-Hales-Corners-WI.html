Making use of natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more environmentally friendly are artificial and urged pesticides should only be used as a last hope or only used as required and often only at specific times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of integrating the use of biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to welcome collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
