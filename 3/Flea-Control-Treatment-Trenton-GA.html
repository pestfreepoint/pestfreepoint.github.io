<p>Thank you for choosing RID Pest Control to protect your home from termites. When kept for a long time, kept product pests are most likely to be in a food component on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food product. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole method of control has led to the development of insect resistance and unfavorable impacts on human health, natural enemies, and the environment.</p>
<p>We historically have offered nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of ecologically unsound approaches in addition to its variety of inherent strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For example, pressures of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have actually been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
