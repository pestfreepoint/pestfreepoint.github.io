<p>This enables the choice of natural enemies that are more effective or simpler to propagate. The pest control operator must have the ability to supply information about the chemical, such as the product security data sheet. Natural control includes the enhancement of naturally happening pest management techniques to combat pests like using useful insects and illness.</p>
