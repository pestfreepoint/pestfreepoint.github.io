IPM is the selection and usage of pest control actions that will make sure beneficial financial condition, social and ecological consequences 13 and is applicable to a lot of agricultural, public health and facility pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>IPM is used in farming, horticulture, forestry, human habitations, preventive conservation and general pest control, consisting of structural pest management, turf pest management and ornamental pest management. Deal with a pest invasion with a hand sprayer, fertilize your turf with a granular spreader, take on termite treatments with a foamer, bait for roaches and ants with a professional bait weapon, or use pre-emergent herbicides with a backpack sprayer.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being practically solely about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management strategies are unable to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is justified.</p>
