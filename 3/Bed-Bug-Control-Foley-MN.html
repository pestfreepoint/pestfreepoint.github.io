<p>A redirection of pest management is needed to include year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and neighborhood levels and to consider the effects of these practices on the overall animals, dietary state, and balance of local environments (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term utilized to explain a methodical approach of managing pests using non-chemical pest management approaches and the judicious use of pesticides when pest populations exceed appropriate levels.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Using beneficial creatures such as insects or fungi that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is put on how natural enemies function and how we can promote their natural effectiveness. Consider soil or substrate health not just in the biological sense: very little presence of soil borne pests or diseases.
