The more plants or areas examined, the most likely the quicker an issue will be discovered, when management is easiest. The objective was to enhance the health and environmental conditions of INDIA by offering professional pest control service at competitive rates.</p>
<p>In referral to the idea of incorporating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later expanded to embrace collaborated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962).
