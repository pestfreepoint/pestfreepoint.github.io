<p>Termites consume furnishings, papers, books, and even documents kept in safes and lockers, hence causing colossal damage within just a couple of months.

Classical biological control involves introducing natural enemies from a pest's native variety into a new location where native natural enemies do not offer control.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest management (IPM) as defined by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) suggests a pest management system in the context of associated environment and population dynamics of the pests types utilizing all suitable strategy and methods in as suitable way as possible and preserving pest population at levels below causing unaccepted damage or loss.</p>
