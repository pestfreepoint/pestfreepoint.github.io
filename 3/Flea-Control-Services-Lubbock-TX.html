<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like roaches, ants, or spiders, we will determine the source of the problem. The goal is to supply an overall understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less efficient in handling the stress caused by insects that extract plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this tension may somewhat reduce the financial threshold.</p>
