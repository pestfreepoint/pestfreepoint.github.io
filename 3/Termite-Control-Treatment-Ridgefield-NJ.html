<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an environment approach to crop production and protection that combines different management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and reduce making use of pesticides. By completing and utilising an IPM strategy, members may be able to conserve money on pest control techniques which were formerly utilized and can potentially lower future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Since they are generally more reliable and can typically be used to control several pests, the bulk of insecticides fall into the chemical category. Physical barriers such as fences, webs, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and reduce the damage they cause.</p>
<p>When pest issues are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis formulations or its cry toxic substances in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well recorded.</p>
