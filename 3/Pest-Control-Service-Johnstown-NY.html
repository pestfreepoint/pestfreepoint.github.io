The following example explains the 6 parts of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-lasting pest avoidance, an effective IPM program makes use of a combination of control techniques including biological control, habitat control, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to determine, handle, and decrease danger from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that decreases overall economic, health, and ecological risks.</p>

<p>Pesticides must be registered by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) before they can be manufactured, provided, offered or utilized in Australia. Quickly confirm the eligibility of a pesticide product for usage in the LEED v4-certified Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program. Almost 10% of stream websites and 1.2% of ground water websites in farming locations, and 6.7% of stream and 4.8% of ground water website in urban locations included pesticides at concentrations going beyond criteria for human health originated from US EPA standards and guidelines for drinking water.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle movies used in organic farming may control some pests, but can adversely affect natural enemies and cause other pests to proliferate (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural enemy populations, but a higher variety of natural enemies does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative effect on the environment.</p>
