Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
