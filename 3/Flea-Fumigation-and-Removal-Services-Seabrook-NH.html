<p>A redirection of pest management is required to integrate year-round soil, weed, cropping, water, and associated practices at farm and community levels and to consider the results of these practices on the total fauna, nutritional state, and balance of regional environments (16 ). Integrated pest management (IPM) is a term used to describe a systematic technique of managing pests using non-chemical pest management techniques and the sensible use of pesticides when pest populations surpass acceptable levels.</p>
<p>Such techniques have been used for a long period of time to deal with pest control concerns within the family along with in agricultural settings. In principle, natural enemies used in these methodologies are biopesticides, and the basic techniques differ from conventional pesticidal applications just in the type of products used. Biological control - biological control in natural plant security is a technique of controlling insect pests and illness using other organisms which rely on herbivory, predation and parasitism, or some other natural mechanisms with active farmer's management interaction.</p>
