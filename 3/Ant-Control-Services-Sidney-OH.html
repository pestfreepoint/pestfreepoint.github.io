<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a community approach to crop production and security that combines different management techniques and practices to grow healthy crops and lessen using pesticides. By completing and using an IPM plan, members might be able to conserve money on pest control techniques which were previously used and can possibly reduce future problems with pesticide resistance on farm. Since they are generally more efficient and can generally be utilized to control several pests, the bulk of insecticides fall into the chemical category. Physical barriers such as fences, webs, mulch, and tree trunk guards can leave out pests and minimize the damage they inflict.</p>
