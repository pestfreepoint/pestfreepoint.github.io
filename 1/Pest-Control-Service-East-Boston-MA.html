The chemical controls are applied just after regular tracking indicates that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level.

<p>Bug, weed, and illness problems are minimized through natural control by the enriched natural enemy fauna, using weed-competitive or disease- and pest-resistant ranges (with an emphasis on durable systems for resistance), reduction of nitrogen fertilization, and sensible usage of chemical pest control based on cautious population sampling and decision limits.</p>
