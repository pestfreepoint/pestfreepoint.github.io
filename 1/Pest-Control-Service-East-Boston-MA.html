The chemical controls are applied just after regular tracking indicates that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Numerous private commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to specify what IPM implies for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in restricted locations.</p>
<p>Bug, weed, and illness problems are minimized through natural control by the enriched natural enemy fauna, using weed-competitive or disease- and pest-resistant ranges (with an emphasis on durable systems for resistance), reduction of nitrogen fertilization, and sensible usage of chemical pest control based on cautious population sampling and decision limits.</p>
