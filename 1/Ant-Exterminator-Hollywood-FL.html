<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove due to the fact that growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan.
