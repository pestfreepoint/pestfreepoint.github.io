<p>Whether you have rodents or regular pests like roaches, spiders, or ants, we will recognize the source of the issue. The goal is to provide a total understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for execution in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less efficient in dealing with the stress brought on by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress may slightly reduce the economic threshold.</p>
