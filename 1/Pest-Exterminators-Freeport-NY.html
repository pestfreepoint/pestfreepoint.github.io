<p>In recommendation to the principle of integrating making use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are naturally more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance.</p>
<p>The human response depends on the significance of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to entirely get rid of the pest.
