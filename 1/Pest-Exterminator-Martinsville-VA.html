<p>The approach to be picked for IPM depends on numerous aspects, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic aspect of the management. Insect pests cause substantial losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If fundamental home hygiene is overlooked, the impacts of other types of pest control will be extremely temporary as the pests will quickly be back, and in higher numbers.</p>

<p>Just like us, pests require water, food, and shelter to survive, and if they can't find these in your house, it's most likely they'll go in other places. If they can not enter it, pests can not survive without food and will not infest a building. Another approach includes using baits that either destroy the pests or prevent them from recreating. C) Reduction in quantities of production and protection inputs of non-renewable resource origin (generally pesticides) while keeping stable productivity levels for the region.</p>
