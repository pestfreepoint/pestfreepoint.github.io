<p>IPM approaches include both chemical and nonchemical methods to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest effective dose when other methods of pest control have failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based technique that concentrates on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment adjustment, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>Tighter regulations for food security, occupational health and safety, and the environment mean internal pest control isn't an alternative for many food services these days. Farmers are faced with myriad of production difficulties where the most common issues are pests, that include insects, illness, and weeds. Similarly, pest and crop management disciplines need to collaborate to establish control recommendations that show these interactions.</p>
<p>Recognition of the pest, understanding its biology and seasonal population patterns, destructive life stages and their environments, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life phase for several control options, host choice and alternate hosts, predictability of pest event based upon the environment, cropping trends, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the associated details is important for identifying an effective control technique.</p>
