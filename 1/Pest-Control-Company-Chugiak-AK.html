Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an approach that includes the management of a pest rather of controlling or removing a pest. TAP insulation for attics, moisture barriers for crawl spaces, and specifically crafted weather condition stripping for garage and entry doors not just deter rodents and other devastating pests from living and entering in your house, they're energy efficient, too.</p>
