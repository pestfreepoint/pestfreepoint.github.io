<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently used against a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>A comprehensive understanding of basic IPM principles and different management alternatives for all possible pest issues is important as some are preventive and others are curative.
