Therefore, a mere switch to nontoxic pesticides, such as microbials or inundative releases of natural enemies, although helpful in minimizing ecological contamination and security issues, still does not really resolve the environmentally based weak point of the standard pest control method.</p>

IPM is most likely to be misunderstood as pest management without chemicals which in reality need based usage of chemicals. Pests can be brought into the food processing center through the supply chain, in the ingredients or product packaging, and the center itself will draw in pests through food smells and lighting.</p>
