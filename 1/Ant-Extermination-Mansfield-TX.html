<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in current decades since fire eliminates advantageous insects in addition to the pests and can have a negative influence on the soil. To lessen potential harm to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to little areas where you can see pests hiding, and leave a couple of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
