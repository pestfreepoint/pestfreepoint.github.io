<p>Provide food and shelter for the useful insects (e.g., flowering plants which provide nectar).

We provide efficient and fast services to your pest problems with exact same day service.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and prevent pest determination consist of intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to coincide with times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
