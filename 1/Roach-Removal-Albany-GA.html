This chapter goes over different methods to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or to put it simply incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and animals far from locations where pesticides have been applied.</p>
<p>If pesticides are required, they are selected and applied in a manner that avoids interfering with other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest positions a risk to the homes they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the application of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or strongly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outside environment.</p>
<p>Using information about pests' biology and routines, along with an arsenal of pest management strategies, pest control workers find, recognize, and eliminate pests. However since these "sex" traps attract mostly male insects, they aren't very effective controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A regular tracking program is the basis of IPM decision making, no matter the control strategies used.</p>
