<p>Simultaneously, it is also based upon semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are fended off or prevented away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be eliminated or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ).
