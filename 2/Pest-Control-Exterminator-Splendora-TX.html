It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Ideally, these thresholds adjust for modifications in market value, phase of crop development, expense of pesticides, and so on, but in reality most are based on fixed invasion or damage levels.</p>
