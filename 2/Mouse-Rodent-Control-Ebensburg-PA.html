<p>Dorchester County runs a Mosquito Control Program to protect its citizens from the spread of mosquito-borne illness by spraying pesticides (insecticides), using larvicide to low-lying locations, and informing its citizens on decreasing the conditions that promote boosts in the mosquito population.

SWPM is susceptible to attack by wood dull insects which, in a collection environment, may cause serious damage to structures, office furniture, specimens and artifacts.
