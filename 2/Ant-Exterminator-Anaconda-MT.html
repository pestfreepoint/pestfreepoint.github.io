<p>At Aegis Pest Control we are dedicated to supplying the very best possible service to safeguard versus undesirable pests. The following example explains the 6 components of an Integrated Pest Management program used to manage carpenter ants. Focusing mainly on long-term pest prevention, an effective IPM program makes use of a combination of control approaches including biological control, environment adjustment, changes to cultural practices and usage of resistant plant varieties.</p>
<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical means to prevent and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are used at the tiniest efficient dose when other methods of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-term avoidance of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook gives existing info on selection, application, and safe use of pest control chemicals. New consumers save 10% off preliminary pest control services or conserve $50 off termite treatments. It is essential that we develop a more active approach that seeks to understand natural opponents and how they function as a part of the ecosystem and to promote their effectiveness by use of habitat management (landscape ecology) and other cultural management methods.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to keep an eye on for pests and recognize them properly, so that appropriate control decisions can be made in conjunction with action limits. Nevertheless, the significant trend has been towards making use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to change traditional pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; but these means are still rehabs.</p>
