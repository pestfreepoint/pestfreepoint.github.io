<p>Many newer pesticides are derived from plants or naturally happening substances (e.g.-- bug, nicotine and pyrethrum juvenile hormone analogues), but the toxophore or active component may be altered to supply increased biological activity or stability. Most scientists agree that this will be possible only if we cultivate crops according to the idea of Integrated Pest Management (IPM).</p>
<p>Simultaneously, it is also based on semiochemicals especially kairomones and allomones 35 The pests are driven away or prevented far from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are all at once attracted (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or gotten rid of 35 (Figure 5 ). The majority of pesticide problems are caused by a small number of the pesticides available today.</p>
<p>Cover or eliminate bird cages and aquarium, and move other animals prior to utilizing aerosol (spray) pesticides. Make sure the individual who will be applying your pesticides holds a legitimate picture ID Pest Control Licence. Customers ought to notify the pest exterminators about the particular infestations prior to the treatment or at the time of booking. Planting potatoes well away from the previous year's crop prevents access to needed food and the beetles will starve.</p>
