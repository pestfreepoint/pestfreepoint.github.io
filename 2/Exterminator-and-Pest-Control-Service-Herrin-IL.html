IPM is an approach to ensure economic viability at both consumer and producer level (seller is constantly expected to make a profit), environmental safety through a balanced usage of all readily available pest control options, and social acceptability given that IPM-based food is safe and budget-friendly.</p>
<p>Each time the crop is searched, record arthropod pest numbers, place within the greenhouse, and the variety of plants checked. It's possible that the repeated usage of pesticides may be more hazardous in the long term than the pests themselves. Preferably, these limits adjust for modifications in market value, stage of crop growth, cost of pesticides, etc., but in reality most are based upon fixed problem or damage levels.</p>
