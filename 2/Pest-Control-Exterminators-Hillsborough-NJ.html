<p>It is discovered in some cases that we require pest control only in a particular area and not everywhere. Our online courses include Crop Pest Diagnostics and Management, along with the first-ever web-based hygienic and phytosanitary procedures curriculum (sponsored by USAID).

Early detection of arthropod pests helps avoid the need to deal with extensive populations that might cause crop damage. Security issues and eco-friendly interruptions continue to ensue (Wright, 1996 ), and there are renewed appeals for effective, safe, and economically acceptable options (Benbrook, 1996 ).
