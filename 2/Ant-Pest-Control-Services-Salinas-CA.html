Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the requirement for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
