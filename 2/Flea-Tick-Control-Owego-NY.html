<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an environment technique to crop production and protection that combines various management strategies and practices to grow healthy crops and decrease using pesticides. By completing and making use of an IPM plan, members may be able to save cash on pest control methods which were formerly used and can possibly decrease future issues with pesticide resistance on farm.
