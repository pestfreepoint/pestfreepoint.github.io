<p>The goal of development must be to protect and where possible increase production of healthy food per hectare, with minimal usage of artificial fertilizer and chemical pesticides. If concerted efforts were made due to the numerous possible causes for brief and long-term diseases and signs associated with exposure to pests and pesticides, documentation would be hard to acquire even.</p>
